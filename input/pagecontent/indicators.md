### Indicators
The FHIR [Measure](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/measure) is used to describe the indicator in a computable format. The tables below show the data elements and highlight some of the measures those are applied in from this IG. For a complete list of measures, visit the [Artifact Index](artifacts.html)

#### Indicator Table Data Element Descriptions

|Data Element|Description|
|---|---|
|Indicator code|Sequential numbering of the indicator|
|Indicator name|Brief name of the indicator|
|Definition|This is a narrative description of the indicator to provide additional context.|
|Numerator definition|The description of numerator used to calculate the indicator.|
|Numerator computation|The calculation or how to derive this numerator. Any specific data elements noted here should align directly with the individual-level Data Element Name.|
|Denominator definition|The description of denominator used to calculate the indicator.|
|Denominator computation|The calculation or how to derive this denominator. Any specific data elements noted here should align directly with the individual-level Data Element Name.|
|Disaggregations|Are there any dis-aggregations that you would like to be able to do in order to conduct the necessary analysis?|
|References|If there are any national or global guidelines (e.g. WHO guidelines) that dictate how and why this indicator should be calculated or reported, it should be noted here. If any guidelines or recommendations change, having a clear reference listed would help in updating or restructuring your data.|
